a. Project description
This is a game that we need to junmp to avoid the obstacles and get scores.

b. A set of user stories
In the menu, as a player, I can click start button so that game starts.
And I can click instruction button so that I can see how I should play the game by pressing the up arrow key.
In the play state, as a player, I can make my character jump to avoid coming obstacles and gain scores from each obstacle that my character jump over.

c. At first, we have a menu that we can choose start game, high score and instruction. In the game, we can use up key to avoid obstacles comes into screen. If we collide with obstacle, game is over. If not, we got scores. And when game is over, we can choose play again or back to menu.
c. 1.As a player, I will have more fun if I can move my character back and forth to avoid the obstacles.
   2.As a player, I also want to have more kinds of monsters that we need to jump over.
   3.As a player, I want to see my highest score in history. There does have high score button, but it doesn't work.
   4.As a player, if two monsters are coming consecutively, I want to have a super jump that I can jump more higher to gain more time in the air.

d. We can add a few ideas about furture development of this software that we aren't be able to do or we dont't have enought time to implement. So that future folks can think about them and improve the software with multiple ideas from others.

e. there is no problems with build.xml, we don't need to change anything.


f. There are ninteen current issues that I think we will earn 1000 point by working on this project. Those issues are clearly express. About change the background image, have shoot method.

g. we add a new issues about super jump which means if two monsters are coming consecutively, we can have a super jump that can jump higher.


h. there are many classes the runner, sheep, snail. These element will move in the game. So the have update there postion each time. And in Country runnerGui, this class keep repaint. So we can see such animation as a complete game. we also have title screen, gameoverJpanel. There are different Jpanel which we don't need to repaint, so we put them in different classes. 

i.these tests just test sprite's initial set methods.
